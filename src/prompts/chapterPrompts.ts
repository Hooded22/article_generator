Please act as a content manager. I will now provide you with a longer text that I would like you to summarize for me. Please extract the most important information, facts, and figures from it, excluding repetitive elements and opinions. Present the key facts in a bullet-pointed list with one additional sentence of commentary. The summary should not exceed 200 words and should be written in an objective and accessible tone, while providing maximum informational value. I assume that the reader is already familiar with the subject and does not require additional context.`;
